<h3>IKEA Blinky Trinkets</h3>
Here we have some code to run two tiny trinkets.<br>
They are nice and easy to build/code for beginners<br>
We hope this is a fun way to get into digital creativity<br>
<br>
A tiny LED matrix display that can scroll a message<br>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
The master brain in these projects is a little device from Adafruit called "Trinket M0".<br>
As always, Adafruit provide <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all">detailed instructions and information</a> about how to get started with their kits.<br>
The hardware can be bought in several places, the most convenient place for me is Lawicel in Tyring (outside HÃ¤sleholm). They carry the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/adafruit-trinket-m0">Trinket M0</a>(120sek), the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/mini-0-8-quot-8x8-led-matrix-i2c-yellow">Tiny Display</a>(130sek) and the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/neopixel-ring-16-x-ws2812-rgb"> LED Rings</a>(100sek each).
The plan is that we add simpler instructions here, for our specific setup.<br>

See you at Maker Friday!<br>
