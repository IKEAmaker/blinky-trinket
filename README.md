<h3>IKEA Blinky Trinkets</h3>
Here we have some code to run two tiny trinkets.<br>
They are nice and easy to build/code for beginners<br>
We hope this is a fun way to get into digital creativity<br>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
The master brain in these projects is a little device from Adafruit called "Trinket M0".<br>
As always, Adafruit provide <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-trinket-m0-circuitpython-arduino?view=all">detailed instructions and information</a> about how to get started with their kits.<br><br>
The hardware can be bought in several places, the most convenient place for me is Lawicel in Tyring (outside HÃ¤ssleholm). They carry the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/adafruit-trinket-m0">Trinket M0</a>(120sek), the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/mini-0-8-quot-8x8-led-matrix-i2c-yellow">Tiny Display</a>(130sek) and the <a href="https://www.lawicel-shop.se/neopixel-ring-16-x-ws2812-rgb"> LED Rings</a>(100sek each).<br><br>
<br>

<h3>Setup your computer</h3>
The bare minimum to get these projects up and running is basiaclly any IKEA compter.<br>
No drivers or software has to be installed, just bring your computer.<br>
<br>
However, for the best experience you might want to install a code editor.<br>
There are both <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/download/1.0.1/mu-editor_1.0.1_osx.dmg">Mac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/download/1.0.1/mu-editor_1.0.1_win64.exe">PC</a> versions.<br>
If your computer is a PC, you might also want to install <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Windows_Drivers/releases/download/2.3.3/adafruit_drivers_2.3.3.0.exe">these drivers</a>.<br>
On a PC there is also the option to download a <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/releases/download/1.0.1/portamu_1.0.1_win64.zip">portable version</a> of the editor that can be run without installing.<br>
<br>
The plan is that we add simpler instructions here, for our specific setup.<br>
<br>
See you at Maker Friday!<br>
